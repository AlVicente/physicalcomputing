## <h2 style="color: blue"></h2>Skittle Picker

#### The general idea for this build-project:
##### An automated "gumball machine," which sorts and presents your skittle of choice in a container. It is different than a mere sorter, as the person gets to pick the color skittle desired on an interface.  

#### Materials: Arduino Uno, TCS34725 Color Sensor, Continuous Rotation Servo
