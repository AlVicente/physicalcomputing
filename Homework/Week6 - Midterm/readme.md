## Skittle or Skream

#### -Ideation-
##### The general idea for this build-project: An automated "gumball machine" which, via a sorter wheel, scoops a random Skittle from a bowl receptacle inside the toy. It drops your skittle of choice in a container. This toy is different from a mere sorter, as the person gets to pick the color Skittle desired on an interface.  
##### * (edit1): You must choose the right Skittle color from the choices on the interface. This sets the internal sorter wheel into motion, whereby it is scooped and carried past a color detector. If you guessed the wrong color, an annoying buzzer starts blaring. The wheel continues rotating and drops the Skittle back in the receptacle and stops. The buzzer only stops when you choose the right Skittle, which falls through a "gate" (maybe using a mini-servo) connected to the Skittle receptacle in front of the toy.
##### * The Interface - You can choose from 10 different Skittles (from available Red and Purple packs).       

##### Materials: Arduino Uno, TCS34725 Color Sensor, PiezoBuzzer, Continuous Rotation Servo, Mini-Servo
